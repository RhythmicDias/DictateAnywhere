# DictateAnywhere

**Hybrid voice dictation for Windows** — types wherever your cursor is, just like macOS Dictation.

Powered by [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) (offline, CPU-efficient) with optional [Azure Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/speech-to-text) cloud fallback for maximum accuracy.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- **Windows 10 / 11** (x64)
- **Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13** — [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A microphone

### Install

```bat
git clone https://github.com/stephendias-NPD/DictateAnywhere.git
cd DictateAnywhere

scripts\create_venv.bat
scripts\install.bat
```

### Run

```bat
scripts\run.bat
```

DictateAnywhere starts silently and appears in the system tray (bottom-right of your taskbar).

---

## Usage

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Start / stop dictation | Press `Ctrl+Alt+D` (configurable) |
| Start / stop dictation | Click the floating mic button |
| Start / stop dictation | Right-click tray icon → Start / Stop |
| Open settings | Right-click tray icon → Settings… |
| View session history | Right-click tray icon → Session History |
| Toggle preview overlay | Right-click tray icon → Toggle Preview |
| Move floating button | Click and drag it anywhere on screen |
| Quit | Right-click tray icon → Quit |

### Transcription preview overlay

While recording, a dark floating bar appears at the bottom of your screen showing:

- **● Listening…** status with a **smooth live waveform visualizer** to show your microphone activity
- The last three dictated lines (newest is white; older lines dim)

The overlay auto-hides a few seconds after dictation ends. You can drag it anywhere and close it with ✕. The hide delay is configurable in Settings → Advanced.

### Countdown ring on the floating button

When recording is active, a sweep arc appears inside the mic button tracking how much of the maximum recording time has been used:

| Ring colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green | > 50% of time remaining |
| Amber | 20–50% of time remaining |
| Red | < 20% remaining — wrapping up soon |

A small seconds counter appears at the top of the button. The ring and counter disappear instantly when recording ends.

### Spoken punctuation commands

| Say | Gets typed |
|---|---|
| "period" / "full stop" | `.` |
| "comma" | `,` |
| "question mark" | `?` |
| "exclamation mark" | `!` |
| "new line" | line break |
| "new paragraph" | blank line |
| "semicolon" | `;` |
| "colon" | `:` |
| "open quote" / "close quote" | `"` |
| "dash" | `—` |
| "ellipsis" | `…` |
| "delete that" / "scratch that" | removes the spoken word |

### Word corrections

Open **Settings → Corrections** to define find-and-replace rules applied after every transcription.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Find | The word or phrase Whisper tends to get wrong |
| Replace | What you actually want typed |

Rules are case-insensitive by default. They are stored in `%APPDATA%\DictateAnywhere\corrections.json` and apply on top of Whisper's output after spoken punctuation processing.

**Example rules:**

| Find | Replace |
|---|---|
| `colour` | `color` |
| `Starbucks` | `Starburst` |
| `gonna` | `going to` |

---

## Configuration

Open **Settings** from the tray icon menu. Changes take effect immediately.

## Azure Speech (optional cloud backend)

The free tier of Azure Speech gives you **5 hours of transcription per month at no cost**.

1. Create a free Azure account at [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
2. Create a **Speech** resource (Free tier F0)
3. Copy your **Key 1** and **Region**
4. In DictateAnywhere Settings → Azure Cloud tab, paste the key and set the region
5. The key is encrypted by Windows and never touches disk in plain text

---

## Sarvam AI (Indian Language specialized STT)

For the best experience with Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, etc., DictateAnywhere integrates with [Sarvam AI](https://www.sarvam.ai/).

1. Get an API key from the [Sarvam AI Dashboard](https://www.sarvam.ai/).
2. In DictateAnywhere **Settings → Sarvam AI** tab:
   - Paste your **API Key** (stored securely in Windows Credential Manager).
   - Select your preferred model (e.g., `saaras:v3`).
   - Enable **WebSocket Streaming** for ultra-low latency real-time transcription.
3. Switch the **Engine Mode** to `sarvam` in the Engine tab.

---

## Auto-update checker

DictateAnywhere silently checks [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/stephendias-NPD/DictateAnywhere/releases) at startup (after a 15-second delay) and shows a notification if a newer version is available.

- **At most once per day** — subsequent launches that day skip the check
- **Three choices when a new version is found:**
  - **Download** — opens your browser to the GitHub release page
  - **Skip this version** — suppresses notifications for that specific release (persisted to config)
  - **Remind me later** — dismisses; will show again on the next daily check
- **Manual check** — Settings → Advanced → Updates → **Check now**
- **Disable entirely** — uncheck "Check for updates automatically"

---

## Session history

Right-click the tray icon → **Session History** to open a log of every utterance dictated in the current run.

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| Search box | Filter utterances by text |
| Copy | Copies selected entry to clipboard |
| Export | Saves full history as a `.txt` file |
| Clear | Wipes the history list |

History is in-memory only and resets on restart. Use Export to save anything you need to keep.
